# bfi: A brainfuck interpreter

bfi is a simple brainfuck interpreter with a lot of area for improvement, it has 
a simple interface and (almost) all the functionality that you could expect from any other 
interpreter.

## Note
	+ File goes is, file goes out
		bfi does not have an interactive prompt
	+ Nested loops are **not suported**, the use of
		them leads to undefined behaviour
